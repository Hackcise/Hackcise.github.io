      <h2>NoFap Journey (DAY 1)</h2>
      <p class="meta">Posted by Nishant Singh Tomar | 29/5/2023</p>
      
      <p>NoFap is a movement and online community centered around abstaining from pornography consumption and masturbation. The term "NoFap" comes from combining "no" and "fap," which is a slang term for male masturbation. While the term originated as a challenge to abstain from masturbation, it has since expanded to include abstaining from pornography as well.</p>
